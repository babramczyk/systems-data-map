## Assumptions

<!-- - System types are static, and only consist of the ones shown in the given sample data. Making this assumption seemed reasonable based on the problem space, and allowed me to not have to piddle around making likely marginal performance optimizations -->

## Notes

- I helped myself to some of your data files [here](https://github.com/ethyca/fideslang) ðŸ˜€
- For filter functionality, one could make the case that I should hide options that don't apply for the current dataset, as they're noisey, and kind of pointless. In the interest of trying to decouple my solution from the dataset, and in the interest of time, I simply show all possibilities as a default. This could definitely change in the future
